-f stirfile: specify a different stirfile
  "-" shall denote the standard input
  XXX should probably support multiple stirfiles?
-i: ignore error codes returned by invoked commands
-k: do as much as you can if an error occurs
-n: dry run
  TODO note that in this:
  a.txt: b.txt
  b.txt: c.txt
  ...if a.txt is newer than b.txt, and you do "touch c.txt; stirmake", it has
  to work.
-q: exit with 0 if target up-to-date; otherwise, exit with 1. No commands.
-S: opposite of -k, the default
-s: silent, don't write to standard output any commands or touch messages
-t: touch mode: touch each not-up-to-date target, write "touch TGT" to stdout
