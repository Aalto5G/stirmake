- Replace $CCCMDS = [[$CC<>, @$CFLAGS<>, "-c", "-o", $@, $<]] with
  $CCCMDS<> = [[$CC<>, @$CFLAGS<>, "-c", "-o", $@, $<]] and support it in abce
  too. Make $CCCMDS = [[$CC<>, @$CFLAGS<>, "-c", "-o", $@, $<]] evalute its
  argument immediately.
- Top-level marker to mark that "stirmake" can parse it directly and it's not
  just for inclusion within other upper-level Stirfiles.

- Make keys of dict memblocks too
- Order only prerequisites
- Two memory areas for engine: temp microcode and global microcode
  - Use signed number to distinguish between two

- when assigning to dynscope, refdn the old dynscope? it's in cache anyway...
