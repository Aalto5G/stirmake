- Option to check heap after every engine invocation to reveal refcnt bugs

- Extra opcodes:
  - path_absolutify

- LuaJIT

- Test adding rules from Amyplan
  - Test @addrule using fn and ctx

- Replace main algorithm? May not work with dynamically added targets.
  - we could continue using it if only deps are dynamically added

- cannot clean anomaly for self-modifying build systems
  - not an issue if only deps are dynamically added

- don't delete targets if the list of cmds is empty? There's no way the target
  is created given an empty list of cmds.

- don't delete rectgtrule targets? or at least those that are within recdep.

- multiple rule types in one, check for saneness

- memory leaks

- ".ORDER: a b" statement to specify that if both a and b are built, a
  is built before b

- Use expr0_without_string instead of expr in places where string can be

- fcntl lock for output, gather child-process outputs together

- instead of '%.c' use ''%'.c'

- more human-readable error messages with backtraces

- automated torture test bench

- @listdict(["a","b"],"n",{"rec":1}) == [{"n":"a","rec":1},{"n":"b","rec":1}]

- @detouchrule to README.md

- @elseif and @else to top-level directive syntax

- shortcutting
