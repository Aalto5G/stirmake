- Top-level marker to mark that "stirmake" can parse it directly and it's not
  just for inclusion within other upper-level Stirfiles???

- LuaJIT

- Adding rules from Amyplan

- Make $<, $@, $^ work in Amyplan

- Extend stiryy.y grammar to cover all cases
  - @patrule
  - ATTAB
  - ATATTAB

- What if tgt+dep have exactly same mtime? How does standard make handle it?

- Replace main algorithm? May not work with dynamically added targets.

- cannot clean anomaly for self-modifying build systems

- verify cdepincludes are not unlinked when there are rules having no cmds/deps

- don't delete targets if the list of cmds is empty? There's no way the target
  is created given an empty list of cmds.

- don't delete rectgtrule targets? or at least those that are within recdep.

- multiple rule types in one, check for saneness

- memory leaks

- ".ORDER: a b" statement to specify that if both a and b are built, a
  is built before b

- Use expr0_without_string instead of expr in places where string can be

- @addrule so that it supports fn and ctx

- fcntl lock for output, gather child-process outputs together
