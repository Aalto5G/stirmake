- Consider adding all prerequisites to $^ just like make does
  - Consider separating order-only prerequisites to $|
  - Consider supporting $+ to allow linking multiple times
  - First steps towards these taken, now TAB command still need work

- Option to check heap after every engine invocation to reveal refcnt bugs

- Extra opcodes:
  - path_absolutify

- LuaJIT

- Adding rules from Amyplan
  - Implement @addrule so that it supports fn and ctx

- Adding deps from Amyplan during execution

- Extend stiryy.y grammar to cover all cases
  - @patrule

- Replace main algorithm? May not work with dynamically added targets.
  - we could continue using it if only deps are dynamically added

- cannot clean anomaly for self-modifying build systems
  - not an issue if only deps are dynamically added

- don't delete targets if the list of cmds is empty? There's no way the target
  is created given an empty list of cmds.

- don't delete rectgtrule targets? or at least those that are within recdep.

- multiple rule types in one, check for saneness

- memory leaks

- ".ORDER: a b" statement to specify that if both a and b are built, a
  is built before b

- Use expr0_without_string instead of expr in places where string can be

- fcntl lock for output, gather child-process outputs together
