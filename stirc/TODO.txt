- Option to check heap after every engine invocation to reveal refcnt bugs

- memory leaks

- ".WAIT" dependency so that "a: b .WAIT c" executes b first and c only after
  b has been executed (assuming no other rules would cause c to be executed)

- Use expr0_without_string instead of expr in places where string can be

- fcntl lock for output, gather child-process outputs together

- instead of '%.c' use ''%'.c'

- automated torture test bench

- @listdict(["a","b"],"n",{"rec":1}) == [{"n":"a","rec":1},{"n":"b","rec":1}]

- @detouchrule to README.md
