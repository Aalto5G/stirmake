- Top-level marker to mark that "stirmake" can parse it directly and it's not
  just for inclusion within other upper-level Stirfiles???

- LuaJIT

- Adding rules from Amyplan

- Reserved words for referring to all/project top and getting the relative path
  from all/project top to current directory
  - Or actually no reference to all top, only to project top, to discourage
    storing stuff in directories of other projects

- Make $<, $@, $^ work in Amyplan

- Extend stiryy.y grammar to cover all cases

- Conditional compilation and configurability

- hooks for make -c and make -b so that sub-build-systems can be cleaned

- What if tgt+dep have exactly same mtime? How does standard make handle it?

- If a command fails with an exit status, rm its cmdline from DB

- Replace main algorithm? May not work with dynamically added targets.

- Topological sort to enable rmdir()
  - reverse it with a linked list traversed in reverse order
