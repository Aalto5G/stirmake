- Replace $CCCMDS = [[$CC<>, @$CFLAGS<>, "-c", "-o", $@, $<]] with
  $CCCMDS<> = [[$CC<>, @$CFLAGS<>, "-c", "-o", $@, $<]] and support it in abce
  too. Make $CCCMDS = [[$CC<>, @$CFLAGS<>, "-c", "-o", $@, $<]] evalute its
  argument immediately. XXX has this been done already?

- Top-level marker to mark that "stirmake" can parse it directly and it's not
  just for inclusion within other upper-level Stirfiles???

- Order only prerequisites

- check that incyy includes prefix

- LuaJIT

- Adding rules from Amyplan

- Reserved words for referring to all/project top and getting the relative path
  from all/project top to current directory
  - Or actually no reference to all top, only to project top, to discourage
    storing stuff in directories of other projects

- Make $<, $@, $^ work in Amyplan

- Extend stiryy.y grammar to cover all cases

- Conditional compilation and configurability

- Actually unlink files in clean

- Holey scopes

- per-rule scopes, so that rules can carry a dynamic scope, adjusting the
  variable assignments

- hooks for make -c and make -b so that sub-build-systems can be cleaned
