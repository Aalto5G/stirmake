.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm stirmake
is a replacement for
.Xr make 1
that aims for precise builds and ease
of build system maintenance. It supports recursive scoping and is programmable
in a custom strongly typed language
.Nm Amyplan
created for 
.Nm stirmake .
.Pp
.Nm stirmake
aims to have high performance which is achieved by a C-based implementation
contrary to many of its competitors (SCons, Rake) that are implemented in
slow interpreted languages (Python, Ruby, respectively).
.Pp
.Nm stirmake
does not even attempt to have the implementation and the input language to be
the same, contrary to the already mentioned SCons and Rake and most importantly
contrary to Shake that requires one to learn a purely functional language
Haskell.
.Pp
.Nm stirmake
aims to be compatible with existing solutions (make) when compatibility is
critical (jobserver, 
.Xr gcc 1
.Fl M
format include files, parallelism with
.Fl j
argument),
similar to existing solutions when the existing solutions got things mostly
right (the rule specification syntax, but now this time rule can have many
targets) and wildly different from existing solutions where existing solutions
are inadequate (string based variable substitution replaced with proper strong
typing, recursive nested scoping supported).
.Pp
It has been a design goal that
.Nm stirmake
can be deployed one project at a time. Projects using
.Xr make 1
can include submodules using
.Nm stirmake
and projects using
.Nm stirmake
can include submodules using
.Xr make 1
with no difficulty at all.
.Pp
Similarly to the version control system
.Xr git 1 ,
you can invoke
.Nm stirmake
within any directory in the project hierarchy and it detects its current
directory relative to project hierarchy top automatically.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width ".Fl test Ao Ar string Ac"
.It Fl a
Build things relative to project hierarchy root. This is automatic if
.Nm stirmake
is invoked as 
.Nm smka .
.It Fl b
Clean all binaries and exit, except if targets were specified, in which case
build the targets afterwards.
.It Fl c
Clean all binaries and exit, except if targets were specified, in which case
build the targets afterwards.
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.
.It Fl f Ao Ar Stirfile Ac
Use
.Ao Ar Stirfile Ac
as the file to read build instructions from.
.It Fl j Ao Ar jobcnt Ac
Use
.Ao Ar jobcnt Ac
jobs. If
.Ao Ar jobcnt Ac
begins with
.Sq a ,
detect CPU count in the system automatically and use that as
job count.
.It Fl p
Build things relative to project root. This is automatic if
.Nm stirmake
is invoked as 
.Nm smkp .
.It Fl t
Build things relative to current directory. This is automatic if
.Nm stirmake
is invoked as 
.Nm smkt .
.It Fl q
Exit with status 0 if target is up-to-date and with status 1 if target is
not up-to-date. Don't do any build steps.
.It Fl v
Print version information and exit.
.El
.Sh "STIRFILE FORMAT"
Each Stirfile must begin with a marker 
.Va @toplevel
or
.Va @subfile
on
the first non-empty line, with the marker saying whether the file is to be
processed on its own or included as part of some other
.Nm stirmake
instance. You may want to specify in the start after the first line marker (on
the second line) an option
.Va @strict ,
which means that free-form tokens are not supported at all. They have somewhat
bad properties and mean that e.g.
.Va 4/2
is not calculated as
.Va 2
but is rather a free-form token referring to a file named
.Pa 4/2 .
.Pp
First of all, you want to create the target
.Va all
which must be marked
.Va @phonyrule
so that you have a default target. This target should be the
first so that it's the default target.
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@toplevel

@phonyrule: "all": "proga" "progb" "progc" "libd.a"
.Ed
.Pp
Note how all strings are quoted. In targets and dependencies, unquoted strings
are supported but it will emit a warning (but if you have
.Va @strict ,
unquoted strings are not supported).
.Pp
Then you specify shell commands for targets:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
"proga": "proga.o" "libd.a"
	cc -o $@ $^
.Ed
.Pp
It's also possible to use an expression-based syntax:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
(["proga"]): (["proga.o", "libd.a"])
@	["cc", "-o", $@, @$^]
.Ed
.Pp
where parentheses are required around expressions for targets and
dependencies, and the expression support for commands works by having
.Va @
before the tabulator. The special variable
.Va $^
is prefixed by
.Va @
to indicate one wants
to join the full contents of the list
.Va $^
into the resulting list and not just
include the list as one list element.
.Pp
The expression based syntax allows one to define arrays and functions:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
$CCCMD<> = ["cc", "-o", $@, @$^]

$DEPS = ["proga.o", "libd.a"]

"proga": $DEPS
@	$CCCMD<>
.Ed
.Pp
Here
.Va <>
in definition mean "define it as one-liner expression function", and
.Va <>
in variable reference means "call it with no arguments if it's a function".
Also,
.Va @
before the tabulator means the command is in the form of array of strings. If
you have multiple commands in the form of array of arrays of strings, you can
have two
.Va @@
symbols before the tabulator:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
$ARCMDS<> = [["rm", "-f", $@], \\
             ["ar", "rvs", $@, @@suffilter($^, ".o")]]

$OBJS = ["liba.o", "libb.o"]

"libfoo.a": $OBJS
@@	$ARCMDS<>
.Ed
.Pp
where the
.Va @
before the
.Fn @suffilter
is required to embed the list containing many entries into the parent list.
Note also the syntax to break the line into two, which requires the \\ sign
to be just before the line feed.
.Pp
It is possible to invoke external utilities to set variable values. For
example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
$PY3PREFIX `= ["python3-config", "--prefix"]
$PY3LIBS ``= ["python3-config", "--libs"]
.Ed
.Pp
Here
.Va $PY3PREFIX
defined by using one backtick before command is a string (containing the final
newline too) and
.Va $PY3LIBS
defined by using two backticks before command is an array. Arrays created by
the command invocation syntax are split by spaces, newlines and tabulators.
.Pp
To remove the newline from
.Va $PY3PREFIX ,
use
.Pp
.Bd -literal
$PY3PREFIXLINE = @strgsub($PY3PREFIX, "\\n", "")
.Ed
.Pp
Of course, functions can be defined in a full programming language:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@function $CCCMD($compiler)
  @locvar $appendlist = ["-o", @D $@, @ @D $^]
  @locvar $resultlist = [$compiler]
  @locvar $i = 0
  @for($i = 0, $i < $appendlist[], $i = $i + 1)
    @append($resultlist, $appendlist[$i])
  @endfor
  @return $resultlist
@endfunction

$DEPS = ["proga.o", "libd.a"]

"proga": $DEPS
@	$CCCMD("gcc")
.Ed
.Pp
Here in this
.Fn $CCCMD
function note that the function has a local scope for local variables, so
all global variables must be prefixed by
.Va @D
for dynamic scoping. You can also scope lexically by
.Va @L .
However, in this example, arguably
.Va @D
is better than
.Va @L
because then subfiles can call the
.Fn $CCCMD
function and the variables
.Va $@
and
.Va $^
then refer to the targets and dependencies in the subfile.
.Pp
You have already seen many data types (arrays, integers, strings). These are
not the only data types. You can have booleans (
.Va @true ,
.Va @false )
and the special null type
.Va @nil ,
and trees that are constructed and accessed like this:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
$TREE = {"ab": 1, "cd": @false, "ef": @nil}
$THISISFALSE = $TREE{"c"."d"}
$THISISTRUE = $TREE{@? "c"."d"}
.Ed
.Pp
Tree keys must always be strings. Note the previous example included an
example of string concatenation syntax too with the
.Ev .
operator, and the
.Va @?
syntax that queries whether the tree has a certain key.
.Pp
For strings, the operations in addition to concatenation include
.Fn @sufsubone ,
.Fn @sufsuball ,
.Fn @suffilter
and
.Fn @suffilterout .
Example of using them:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
$MODS = ["moda", "modb"]
$ALLTGTA = @sufsubone($MODS[0], "", "/all")
$ALLTGTS = @sufsuball($MODS, "", "/all")
$LINKEDS = ["foo.o", "libbar.a"]
$FOOSRC = @sufsubone($LINKEDS[0], ".o", ".c")
$OBJECTS = @suffilter($LINKEDS, ".o")
$ALLELSE = @suffilterout($LINKEDS, ".o")
.Ed
.Pp
Sub-directories can be included in the following manner
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@dirinclude "module1"
@dirinclude ["module2", "module3"]
$ADDMODS = ["module4, "module5"]
@dirinclude $ADDMODS
.Ed
.Pp
Files can be included into the same scope with
.Va @fileinclude .
It is most commonly used with
.Va @ignore
to include configuration files that can be missing. As the file is included
into the same scope, the variables defined in it can be accessed easily.
Example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@fileinclude @ignore "opts.smk"
$CC ?= "clang"
$CFLAGS ?= ["-O3", "-Wall"]
.Ed
.Pp
This example sets the
.Va $CC
and
.Va $CFLAGS
variables only if they haven't been already defined in
.Pa opts.smk .
.Pp
Sub-projects can be included, too, but it's recommended to control which
variables are visible so that you won't pollute the variable namespace of the
sub-project.
.Pp
.Bd -literal
$ISVISIBLE = "foo"
$NOTVISIBLE = "bar"
@beginholeyscope
  $ISVISIBLE = @LP $ISVISIBLE
  @projdirinclude "subproject"
@endscope
.Ed
.Pp
Here the specified
.Va @LP
means access lexical parent scope. In this very example, it would be exactly
the same as
.Va @DP ,
but in general, in some situations
.Va @LP
and
.Va @DP
can be different.
.Pp
Rules can have many targets:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
stiryy.tab.c stiryy.tab.h: stiryy.y
	byacc -d -p stiryy -o stiryy.tab.c stiryy.y
.Ed
.Pp
Sub-makes can be invoked in the following manner:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@detouchrule: subproj/bin/cmd subproj/lib/libsp.a: @recdep subproj
	make -C subproj

@cleanhook:
	make -C subproj clean

@distcleanhook:
	false

@bothcleanhook:
	make -C subproj clobber
.Ed
.Pp
Here
.Va @recdep
means depend on the latest mtime within the directory hierarchy and
.Va @detouchrule
is required for the rule if some of the targets are inside the same hierarchy.
An alternative for
.Va @detouchrule
is
.Va @rectgtrule
or
.Va @mayberule
but it is the author's opinion that
.Va @detouchrule
works the best.
.Pp
If you invoke sub-make within the same directory, the targets need to be
.Va @maybe
like this:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@maybe: test: test.c test.mk
	make -f test.mk

@cleanhook:
	make -f test.mk clean

@distcleanhook:
	false

@bothcleanhook:
	make -f test.mk clobber
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm stirmake
generates cleaning rules automatically for its own targets, but
cleaning hooks are required for sub-makes. Note how sub-makes may not support
all clean types, so in the example
.Va @distcleanhook
which cleans only binaries and is invoked by
.Nm stirmake
.Fl b
is not supported, whereas
.Va @cleanhook
invoked by
.Nm stirmake
.Fl c
and
.Va @bothcleanhook
invoked by
.Nm stirmake
.Fl bc
are supported.
.Pp
.Nm stirmake
needs to
know what files are binaries and what are object files, so the rules for
binaries are marked
.Va @distrule
like this:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@distrule: binfoo: binfoo.c
	cc -o binfoo binfoo.c
.Ed
.Pp
This
.Va @distrule
marks entire target set of the rule as binaries. To specify individual
targets as binaries in rules that may have multiple targets, use
.Va @disttgt
like this:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@disttgt binfoo: binfoo.c
	cc -o binfoo binfoo.c
.Ed
.Pp
Each target can be listed only once, but additional dependencies can be
specified with
.Va @deponly
like this:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
all: foo bar
	echo all done

@deponly: all: baz
.Ed
.Pp
Some of the stuff can be conditional:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
all: foo bar
	echo all done

$BUILD_BAZ = @false

@if($BUILD_BAZ)
  @deponly: all: baz
@endif
.Ed
.Pp
Pattern rules can be specified:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
$(SRC) = ["foo.c", "bar.c", "baz.c"]
$(OBJ) = @sufsuball($(SRC), ".c", ".o")
$(DEP) = @sufsuball($(SRC), ".c", ".d")

@patrule: $(OBJ): '%.o': '%.c' '%.d'
@	[$(CC), @$(CFLAGS), "-c", "-o", $@, $<]
@patrule: $(DEP): '%.d': '%.c'
@	[$(CC), @$(CFLAGS), "-MM", "-o", $@, $<]
.Ed
.Pp
and the C dependencies produced by the prior example can be included:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@cdepincludes @autophony @autotarget @ignore $(DEP)
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Va @autophony
means the
.Fl MP
argument is not required, because
.Nm stirmake
generates internally the phony targets automatically. Similarly,
.Va @autotarget
means the
.Fl MT
option is not required twice to specify that the dependency files too
must depend on header files (with
.Va @autotarget ,
.Nm stirmake
does the additional targets automatically). Also, in a clean build, the files
are missing, so
.Va @ignore
means don't worry about missing files.
.Pp
Order-only dependencies, i.e. dependencies that are satisfied always when
the file/directory exists without depending on the timestamp, are supported.
Example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
obj/bar.o: bar.c @orderonly obj
@	["cc", "-c", "-o", $@, $<]

obj:
@	["mkdir", "obj"]
.Ed
.Pp
This example does not trigger rebuild of
.Pa obj/bar.o
if the timestamp of the directory changed, which it often does.
.Pp
The special variable
.Va $^
does not contain the order-only dependencies and the same is true for the
special variable
.Va $+
too. (The difference between
.Va $^
and
.Va $+
is that the latter contains duplicate dependencies, if some dependencies are
duplicated.) If you want a list of order-only dependencies, use the special
variable
.Va $| .
.Pp
Parallelism can be controlled by
.Va @order
and
.Va @wait .
The
.Va @order
specifies an order in which two rules are executed. For example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@order 'all' 'install'
.Ed
.Pp
means that the target
.Sq all
is executed before the target
.Sq install ,
if both targets are executed. However, this does not mark
.Sq install
dependent on the target
.Sq all ,
meaning that if only
.Sq install
is requested to be executed,
.Sq all
won't be executed. Note it's easy to make circular dependencies that appear
only if some combination of targets is specified if the
.Va @order
directive is used.
.Pp
It's also possible to use
.Va @wait
to specify that when evaluating dependency lists, there is a wait position in
which dependencies after the wait position are evaluated only after
dependencies before the wait position are evaluated. An example:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@phonyrule: 'all': 'a' 'b' @wait 'c' 'd'
@phonyrule: 'a':
	echo a
@phonyrule: 'b':
	echo b
@phonyrule: 'c':
	echo c
@phonyrule: 'd':
	echo d
.Ed
.Pp
means that
.Sq a
and
.Sq b
are executed first, and only when both
.Sq a
and
.Sq b
have been executed, will
.Sq c
and
.Sq d
be executed afterwards.
.Pp
In
.Va @-<TAB>
syntax, one can specify the identifiers
.Va @ignore ,
.Va @noecho
and
.Va @ismake .
The
.Va @ignore
means exit status is ignored and is used as follows:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@phonyrule: 'all':
@	@ignore ["false"]
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va @noecho
means the command is not echoed and is used as follows:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@phonyrule: 'all':
@	@noecho ["echo", "foo"]
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va @ismake
means the command is a sub-make for which
.Ev MAKEFLAGS
environment variable needs to be set up and is used as follows:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@phonyrule: 'all':
@	@ismake ["make", "-C", "subdir"]
.Ed
.Pp
Note that stirmake is able to detect typical paths to the
.Xr make 1
binary, so in many cases, the
.Va @ismake
specifier is not required.
.Sh "LUAJIT INTEGRATION"
.Pp
.Nm stirmake
can be integrated with
.Nm LuaJIT
by compiling it, either with
.Nm stirmake
having
.Pp
.Bd -literal
$(WITH_LUA) = @true
.Ed
.Pp
in
.Nm opts.smk
or with GNU
.Xr make 1
having
.Pp
.Bd -literal
WITH_LUA=yes
.Ed
.Pp
as the command-line argument. When
.Nm LuaJIT
support is available,
it is possible to add Lua snippets like this that can contain
.Fn Abce.getlexval ,
.Fn Abce.getdynval ,
.Fn Abce.makelexcall
and
.Fn Abce.makedyncall
calls:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@function $FOO($x)
  @stdout("foo\\n")
  @dump($x)
  @return $x
@endfunction

$VALUE = 2

%lua{
  print(Abce.getlexval("VALUE"))
  tbl=Abce.makelexcall("FOO", {"a", "b", 3, 4, 5, {6, {a=1, b=2, c=3}}})
  print(tbl[1])
  print(tbl[2])
  print(tbl[3])
  print(tbl[4])
  print(tbl[5])
  print(tbl[6][1])
  print(tbl[6][2]["a"])
  print(tbl[6][2]["b"])
  print(tbl[6][2]["c"])
%}
.Ed
.Pp
The difference between the
.Sq lex
and
.Sq dyn
variants is that
.Sq lex
refers to lexical scoping and
.Sq dyn
refers to dynamic scoping.
.Pp
Rules/dependencies cannot be directly added from Lua, but indirectly
via
.Nm Amyplan
functions they can be added. Example of adding rules from Lua:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
@phonyrule: 'all': 'dummy'

@function $LUARULE($x)
  @addrule($x)
@endfunction

%lua{
  function rulefromlua(x)
    local y = {tgts={{name="dummy"}}, attrs={phony=true}}
    Abce.makelexcall("LUARULE", y)
    return 0
  end
%}

@call @lexluacall("rulefromlua", 5)
.Ed
.Pp
Note here the alternative 
.Fn @lexluacall
way of calling Lua. This is a lexical call. Dynamic calls are supported too via
.Fn @dynluacall .
.Pp
Similarly,
.Fn @adddeps
can be invoked via an
.Nm Amyplan
function.
.Sh "DYNAMICALLY ADDING RULES AND DEPS"
The sole argument of 
.Fn @addrule
is such that the tree can contain 
.Va tgts ,
.Va deps ,
.Va attrs
and
.Va shells
entries. The
.Va tgts
entry is an array of trees where every
tree contains at least the
.Va name
attribute, and possibly the
.Va dist
attribute. The
.Va deps
entry is an array of
trees where every tree contains at least the 
.Va name
attribute, and possibly
.Va rec
and
.Va orderonly
boolean attributes. The
.Va attrs
can contain
the following attributes that are all boolean: 
.Va phony ,
.Va rectgt ,
.Va detouch ,
.Va maybe ,
.Va dist ,
.Va deponly ,
.Va iscleanhook ,
.Va isdistcleanhook
and
.Va isbothcleanhook .
.Pp
The
.Va shells
is an array of shell invocations, where shell invocation can
have 
.Va embed ,
.Va isfun ,
.Va ismake ,
.Va ignore ,
and
.Va noecho
boolean attributes.
Here
.Va ismake
means it's a sub-make so pass the jobserver and
.Ev MAKEFLAGS
environment variable to it, and
.Va ignore
means ignore a non-zero exit status. Furthermore,
.Va noecho
means that the command line is not echoed. Also,
.Va embed
means
it's an array of arrays of command-line arguments that should be embedded, and
not an array of command-line arguments that should be appended. If
.Va isfun
is
.Dv @true ,
there are attributes 
.Va fun
for function and
.Va arg
for its sole argument. Otherwise, if
.Va embed
is
.Dv @true ,
you need to
specify the
.Va cmds
argument, and if
.Va embed
is
.Dv @false ,
you need to specify the
.Va cmd
argument.
.Pp
Rules can be added only in the parsing stage, not in the execution stage
(execution stage means from shell command hooks that are evaluated after
parsing). However, dependencies can be added in any stage, but only for
rules that have not been executed fully yet.
.Pp
The three arguments of
.Fn @adddeps
are such that the first argument is an array of strings (target names),
the second argument is an array of strings (dependency names), and the third
argument is a tree that can contain
.Va orderonly
and
.Va rec
attributes that are boolean.
.Sh "INVOKING STIRMAKE"
Suppose you have the project hierarchy:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
.Pa project/Stirfile
.It
.Pa project/dir/Stirfile
.It
.Pa project/dir/subproj/Stirfile
.It
.Pa project/dir/subproj/subdir/Stirfile
.El
.Pp
Then the following commands are equal:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
cd project/dir/subproj/subdir; smkt ../all
cd project/dir/subproj/subdir; smkp all
cd project/dir/subproj/subdir; smka dir/subproj/all
.Ed
.Pp
because
.Nm smka
refers to whole project hierarchy,
.Nm smkp
refers to the current project, and
.Nm smkt
refers to the current diretory. In the example, it was assumed that subproj
was included with
.Va @projdirinclude
.Sh "EXIT STATUS"
.Nm stirmake
exits with zero exit status for success, if all Stirfiles could be read, parsed
and all targets / clean operations were successfully performed, or if
.Fl q
was used and the targets are up-to-date. An exit status of one is used for
.Fl q
in cases where the targets are not up-do-date, and an exit status of two will
be reported for error cases.
.Sh "FILES"
.Bl -column Stirfile -compact
.It Pa Stirfile Ta instructions to build a module
.It Pa .stir.db Ta build command database (automatically maintained)
.El
.Sh "ENVIRONMENT"
.Nm stirmake
gets and sets the following environment variables:
.Pp
.Bl -column STIRMAKEPID -compact
.It Ev MAKEFLAGS Ta for GNU Xr make 1 compatibility
.It Ev STIRMAKEPID Ta for communicating parent process identifier to sub-processes
.El
.Sh "COMPATIBILITY"
.Nm stirmake
is mostly incompatible with most
.Xr make 1
implementations because of the support
for data typing, support for full programmability and slightly different
syntax. However,
.Nm stirmake
can read
.Xr make 1
dependency files in the format
.Xr make 1
expects them, created by e.g. the
.Xr gcc 1
.Fl M
argument. Also,
.Nm stirmake
speaks the GNU
.Xr make 1
jobserver protocol, being able to operate as a jobserver
host and guest.
.Pp
It is expected that most conversions to
.Nm stirmake
involve a complete rewrite of the entire build system of the project.
.Sh "SEE ALSO"
.Xr make 1
.Sh HISTORY
No history section of
.Nm stirmake
would be complete without mentioning the venerable make[1], created by Stuart
Feldman of AT&T Bell Laboratories. However, most users of
.Xr make 1
have found it is a rather limited tool.
.Pp
.Nm stirmake
was created inspired by the influential "Recursive Make Considered
Harmful" paper[2] and the author's unsuccessful attempts at creating a perfect
build system using GNU
.Xr make 1 .
It seems the author is not the only one with
difficulty of creating good build systems[3]. Some of the data structures of
.Nm stirmake
are taken from a packet processing toolkit (PPTK) that has its origins in
2017-8.
.Nm stirmake
was created in 2019.

.Sh BUGS
The software is in beta, so bugs are plentiful. Here is a list of some:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Va 4/2
is not calculated as
.Va 2 ,
but rather refers to a file named
.Pa 4/2 .
To fix this, use the
.Va @strict
mode. However, then free-form token support is entirely disabled.
.It
If doing
.Pp
.Bd -literal
cp file.c file.c.bak
$EDITOR file.c
smka
mv file.c.bak file.c
smka
.Ed
.Pp
there will not be a rebuild of files depending on
.Pa file.c ,
because its timestamp is older than that of
.Pa file.o .
.It
Some error codes are translated to
.Dq "Unknown error"
instead of a descriptive
error message.
.It
Targets may be deleted even if the list of commands to create such a target is
empty, when running clean.
.It
There are plenty of memory leaks.
.It
The output sync feature is a quick undocumented hack and not complete yet.
.It
There is no support for 
.Va @elseif
and
.Va @else
in top-level syntax,
although you can have these within functions.
.It
The man page should contain plenty of examples, but it does not.
.It
The 
.Va +=
top-level array plus-assignment operator is buggy.
.It
Commands not using the
.Va @-<TAB>
expression based syntax cannot use variables other than
.Va $@ ,
.Va $< ,
.Va $^ ,
.Va $|
and
.Va $+ .
.It
.Nm stirmake
can be slightly slower for null builds than GNU
.Xr make 1
if the GNU
.Xr make 1
system is
extremely well designed. However, who has seen an extremely well designed GNU
.Xr make 1
based build system? The author of
.Nm stirmake
certainly hasn't seen
such systems except those done by the author himself.
.It
.Va @patrule
rules cannot use the special
.Sq %
character for anything else than wildcard. The wildcard itself can however
refer to strings containing the special
.Sq %
character.
.It
If stirmake is interrupted, targets that are being built are not removed after the
children are dead.
